==========
lck.common
==========

This library consists of various simple common routines and language constructs
that are so useful they ten to be rewritten in every subsequent project I'm
working on. Each function, decorator or module on its own is too simple to
dedicate an entire PyPI package for it.  Together however, this library
represents a Swiss army knife for everyday needs (YMMV). Among the things you
might find inside:

 * robust memoization
   
 * some less obvious collections (e.g. ``orderedset``)

 * a ``@synchronized`` decorator (with threading or lockfile backends)

 * some controversial language enhancements like the Null object

 * converter from ElementTree instances to dicts

 * file finder (searching locations commonly used for storing app data)

The latest version can be installed via `PyPI 
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lck.common/>`_::

  $ pip install lck.common
  
or::

  $ easy_install lck.common

The `source code repository <http://github.com/LangaCore/kitpy>`_ and 
`issue tracker <http://github.com/LangaCore/kitpy/issues>`_ are 
maintained on `GitHub <http://github.com/LangaCore/kitpy>`_.

For the curious, ``lck`` stands for LangaCore Kit. LangaCore is a one man
software development shop of mine.

**Note:**  ``lck.common`` requires **Python 2.7** because all of its code is using
the so-called four futures (``absolute_imports``, ``division``, ``print_function``
and ``unicode_literals``). One of the virtues in the creation of this library
is to make the code beautiful. These switches give a useful transitional
state between the old Python 2.x and the new Python 3.x. You should use them as
well.
