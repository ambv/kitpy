"""langacore.kit.concurrency.synchronization
   -----------------------------------------

   Implements a reusable Java-like synchronization decorator.
   It is using threading locks or filesystem-based locks to synchronize
   subsequent calls of the specified functions. The former kind of
   lock is reentrant, the latter is not.

   For filesystem-based locks the module is using Skip Montanaro's
   `lockfile <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lockfile>`_ library,
   compatible with Windows and POSIX environments."""

               with this specific synchronization decorator. This is 
               useful when a group of functions should be synchronized
               together.
        :param path: instead of using threading-based locking, file-based
               locks may be used instead. Beware, these are radically
               less performant than threading locks.
