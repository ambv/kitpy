langacore.kit.common
--------------------

This library consists of various simple common routines and language 
constructs that are so useful they ten to be rewritten in every 
subsequent project we're working on. Each function, decorator or module 
on its own is too simple to dedicate an entire PyPI package for it. 
Together however, this tiny library represents a Swiss army knife for 
everyday needs [1]_.

The latest version can be installed via `PyPI 
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/langacore.kit.common/>`_::

  $ pip install langacore.kit.common
  
or::

  $ easy_install langacore.kit.common

The `source code repository <http://github.com/LangaCore/kitpy>`_ and 
`issue tracker <http://github.com/LangaCore/kitpy/issues>`_ are 
maintained on `GitHub <http://github.com/LangaCore/kitpy>`_.

.. note::
  Since 0.2.0 ``langacore.kit.common`` does require **Python 2.7** 
  because one of the virtues in the creation of this library is to make 
  the code beautiful.
