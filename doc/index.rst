langacore.kit.common
--------------------

This library consists of various simple common routines and language constructs that are so useful they ten to be rewritten in every subsequent project we're working on. Each function, decorator or module on its own is too simple to dedicate an entire PyPI package for it. Together however, this tiny library represents a Swiss army knife for everyday needs [1]_.

The latest version can be installed via `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/langacore.kit.common/>`_::

  $ pip install langacore.kit.common
  
or::

  $ easy_install langacore.kit.common
